New Release! 18-07-2003

- Added a new little program to register DLL's and OCX's (You must put it with regsvr32.exe - you can find it in C:\windows\system32)
- Now you just need MSVBVM600.DLL to run setup!
- C++ Shell to run batch files hidden!

Let's explain:

Now...no way a vb6 app can run without runtime files but...
To run the DLL-OCX Rsv (register server), you just need to put it with MSVBVM600.DLL.
So, let's put MSVBVM600.DLL, RSV.EXE, REGSVR32.EXE and the other files you may need (ocx's...) in a separate directory, called "RES"
under the main setup directory. So we'll have


SETUP
   setup.exe
   script.txt
   RES
      msvbvm600.dll
      rsv.exe
      regsvr32.exe
      other files...

Now, let's also add a file called REG.BAT to SETUP dir. Add also the given C++ shell (ShellExec.exe)

Let's see:
we can set the reg.bat file to be

[code]
@echo off
@cd res
regsvr32 -s msvbvm60.dll
rsv >nul
cd..
cls
Setup.exe
exit
[/code]

The situation is

SETUP
   setup.exe
   script.txt (may put it into res...it's up to you :D)
   shellexec.exe
   reg.bat
   RES
      msvbvm600.dll
      rsv.exe
      regsvr32.exe
      other files..

So: we can run ShellExec.exe -> it'll open reg.bat, but nobody will see it ;)
Reg.bat will register the needed dll, then let rsv.exe do the rest.
Now we're ready. We can run Setup.exe from the main directory!

No dll or ocx needs to be installed on the pc before running the program...it'll do everyting!

Bye! -loopz
